Why does Jackson 2.6 work and Jackson 2.7+ fail?

Run the tests with the default Maven profile to see them succeed.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw test
----

You can run the tests with Jackson 2.7 using the jackson27 profile and see them fail

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw test -Pjackson27
----

You can run the tests using jackson 2.8 using the jackson28 profile and see them fail

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw test -Pjackson28
----
